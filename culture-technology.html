    <h2>Culture & Technology</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Culture System</h3>
      <p>Want your own culture with specific bonuses to your playstyle? Your culture will be created based on your gameplay. When you first create a culture or receive an ability offer, you must create your culture name and, if you want, a culture icon. After that, you will gain up to 4 abilities to enhance your playstyle.</p>
      
      <p>You can gain culture abilities in 2 major ways: By filling requirements, and by being offered by the mods.</p>
      
      <div class="culture-process">
        <h4>Requesting Culture Abilities</h4>
        <p>When you want a culture ability, you can create a ticket in (). Submit your culture name and icon, and a summary of one unique aspect of your culture. You may also link to some examples of this to showcase your point, whether your worldbuilding, map, exploration, or war. Then, submit what you want your ability to be.</p>
        
        <p>If the mod deems this enough, you will be granted a culture ability. If not, the mod will give you a requirement, which you will need to complete to unlock this ability. If the mod deems your action significant enough, they will invite you into a culture ticket, along with an ability offer.</p>
        
        <p>After unlocking an ability, you can discuss with the mods to further refine the ability to your liking. Once both of you come to a conclusion, your ability will be added to the official list.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Subcultures</h4>
      <p>Each culture may also have up to 2 subcultures, which are extra abilities tied to regions within your nation. These may be acquired by several methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creating a subculture:</strong> Within your land. This will be tied to specific regions within your nation as designated by the culture mod, and have specific requirements similar to regular culture abilities</li>
        <li><strong>Trading abilities:</strong> Each player's or NPC's culture abilities may be traded to other players, where they will become subculture abilities of the target player. You must designate a region in your nation to tie this ability to</li>
        <li><strong>Conquest adoption:</strong> Each player may trade or annex land of another player, where they may choose to adopt that player's ability as their subculture. If your nation conquers the land of another player's subculture, you may choose to adopt their subculture instead. The acquired land will be designated as your subculture region</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technology System</h3>
      <p>Technology gives you further pre-set abilities that enhance your nation. You can unlock technology by researching the technology. You may only research 1 technology per week.</p>
      
      <div class="research-process">
        <h4>Research Process</h4>
        <p>Research involves writing a minimum 300 worldbuilding posts about the real world history of the technology, and how this applies to your nation, or other world building pieces relating to the technology if approved by the culture mod (such as infographic, art, or even real life recreations). Post this in your technology chat and wait for the culture mod to grade it. Once graded, the technology will show up as "unlocked" in the player sheet.</p>

      <h3>Domestication & Selective Breeding</h3>
      <p>Domestication and selective breeding allows you to generate food in new terrain or create new resources. For any wild lifeforms you encountered or designed, you may domesticate 1 lifeform per week. Each domestic life form has a native terrain, and their status as either crops, livestock, mount, or pet.</p>
      
      <div class="domestication-info">
        <h4>Domestication Process</h4>
        <p>All domesticated life forms will start off as crops (plant) or livestock (animal). You may worldbuild about a domestic lifeform even if you didn't mechanically domesticate it.</p>
        
        <p>You will only be able to generate food in terrain your domestic life form is native to (crops for farmer, livestock for herder, gatherers may generate food from any terrain).</p>
        
        <p>For each domestic lifeform in terrains you already have, they will be added to your pool of domestic life forms on the player sheet, each one giving 2 extra food per cycle. You may trade a domestic lifeform you have to other players without losing them using the technology chat.</p>
        
        <h4>Selective Breeding</h4>
        <p>After you unlock selective breeding technology, you may also selectively breed 1 life form per week. This will either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Give existing life form access to new terrain</li>
          <li>Turn them into mount (only some animals will be able to turn into mount)</li>
          <li>Turn them into pets (plants and animals) which will maintain their native terrain</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Mount will unlock mount resources in their native terrain. Pet will act as a new type of unique resource you may use.</p>
