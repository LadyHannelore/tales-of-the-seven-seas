    <!-- Domestication & Selective Breeding Tutorial Section -->
    <section class="tutorial-section">
      <h3>Domestication &amp; Selective Breeding</h3>
      <p>Domestication and selective breeding allows you to generate food in new terrain or create new resources. For any wild lifeforms you encountered or designed, you may domesticate <strong>one lifeform per week</strong>. Each domestic life form has a native terrain and is classified as crops (plants), livestock (animals), mounts, or pets. All domesticated life forms start off as crops or livestock.</p>
      <p>You will only be able to generate food in terrain your domestic life form is native to (crops for farmers, livestock for herders; gatherers may generate food from any terrain).</p>
      <p>Each domestic lifeform in terrains you already have will be added to your pool of domestic species on the player sheet, granting <strong>2 extra food per cycle</strong>. You may trade a domestic lifeform without losing it using the technology chat.</p>
      <p>After unlocking selective breeding technology, you may also selectively breed <strong>one life form per week</strong>. This can either extend an existing lifeform‚Äôs native terrain or transform it into a mount (for resource production) or a pet (unique resource), maintaining its native terrain.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Lifestyle Tutorial Section -->
    <section class="tutorial-section">
      <h3>Lifestyle Choices</h3>
      <p>You must choose one lifestyle at spawn, which grants specific bonuses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Farmer</strong>: Settled farmers produce <strong>1 food per tile</strong>. Start with one custom crop. Can have crops and livestock. May expand into herder and gatherer lands without declaring war.</li>
        <li><strong>Gatherer</strong>: Foragers and fishermen produce <strong>0.5 food per tile</strong>. Cannot have crops or livestock. Select one native terrain for +1 food per tile there. Will produce from all terrains regardless of domestic species. Discovering new wildlife grants +3 food (defeat hostile creatures by roleplay).</li>
        <li><strong>Herder</strong>: Nomadic pastoralists produce <strong>0.33 food per tile</strong>. Start with one custom livestock. Can have crops and livestock. Expansion cost varies by terrain. Settlements have fixed expansion and trade ranges. May use food to replace mount consumption after unlocking domestic mounts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Culture Abilities Tutorial Section -->
    <section class="tutorial-section">
      <h3>Culture Abilities</h3>

    <section class="tutorial-section">
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>Technology unlocks new preset abilities. Research one technology per week by posting a <strong>300-word worldbuilding essay</strong> in the technology chat. Once graded, it appears as ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Selective Breeding</strong>: Breed lifeforms for terrain access or new roles (mounts, pets).</li>
        <li><strong>Shipbuilding</strong>: +3 settlement range and +5 trade range on calm seas.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Sea Sailing</strong>: Requires Shipbuilding; extends sea range and exploration.</li>

    <!-- Settlement Tutorial Section -->
    <section class="tutorial-section">
      <h3>Settlement</h3>
      <p>Settlements allow you to expand, defend, grow your population, and trade.</p>
      <p>Every settlement has its own population. Each cycle, <strong>1 population consumes 1 food and produces 1 labor</strong>. Labor can be used to spawn resources or fight wars.</p>
      <p>Settlements have a <strong>3 tile expansion range</strong> and a <strong>5 tile trade range</strong> (<em>10 for herders</em>). New settlements must be constructed within your land and expansion range.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Town</strong>: Constructed using 2 food, 1 labor. Population: 1.</li>
        <li><strong>City</strong>: Upgraded from Town using 2 copper, 1 bronze, 3 timber, 25 coins, and 1 unique resource. Population: 3. Grants +15 coins passive income with Law technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Metropolis</strong>: Upgraded from City using 4 bronze, 50 coins, and 3 unique resources. Population: 5. Grants +30 coins passive income with Law technology and unlocks book resources.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Trade Tutorial Section -->
    <section class="tutorial-section">
      <h3>Trade</h3>
      <p>You may trade with any player whose settlement is within your trade range. You can trade coins, resources, labor, domestic lifeforms, or personal creations/services.</p>
      <p>Trade routes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Land</strong>: Path between settlements by land (can cross rivers, not lakes or sea).</li>
        <li><strong>Sea</strong>: Requires Shipbuilding for calm sea and Open Sea Sailing for open sea.</li>
        <li><strong>River</strong>: Path along the same river or lake (connected without land or ocean), any length.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Trade types:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Direct Trade</strong>: Single route only; settlements must be within your trade range (or on same waterway).</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect Trade</strong>: Through middlemen settlements; one route type per segment; each segment must be within trade range. Middlemen can block, tax, or take goods if they don't respond within 24 hours.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Trade example format:</p>
      <pre>
@ Player1, resource_gain, resource_lost
@ Player2, resource_gain, resource_lost
@ Middleman
      </pre>
