    <h2>Treaties & Diplomacy</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Treaty System</h3>
      <p>Not every problem needs a violent solution. Treaties allow you to make diplomatic deals with any nation you meet in your region or through exploration, ranging from roleplay deals to exchanging goods or ending conflicts. Unlike regular dealings, treaties will let you put your deals in stone.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Treaties will NOT do the actions themselves, such as trading land, and you must follow their effect separately.</p>

      <h3>Creating Treaties</h3>
      <div class="treaty-process">
        <h4>Treaty Process</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Treaties must be posted in worldbuilding chat, and could be graded as roleplay if the worldbuilding mod deems it appropriate</li>
          <li>All parties must sign the treaty</li>
          <li>You may invite third parties to sign the treaty as "witnesses"</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Treaty Enforcement</h4>
        <p>Treaties have no mechanical effect (other than being graded as roleplay), and the effect must be enforced by its signers. This may range from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Punishment from the witness, such as an invasion or losing status from unofficial alliances</li>
          <li>Trade embargos or technological uncooperation</li>
          <li>Any action you can do yourself is allowed</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Mechanical Enforcement</h3>
      <div class="mechanical-enforcement">
        <h4>Writing Technology Requirement</h4>
        <p>If at least one of the players signing the treaty unlock writing technology, the treaty may gain <strong>mechanical enforcement</strong>. This is when the treaty is officially enforced by the mods and cannot be broken. No unrelated players may sign a mechanically enforced treaty.</p>
        
        <h4>Peace Treaties</h4>
        <p><strong>Peace treaties</strong>, treaties used to end wars, are automatically mechanically enforced whether the player has unlocked writing or not. You must post the treaty in your war ticket. The treaty's effect will immediately be enforced after both parties sign.</p>

      <h3>Best Practices</h3>

          <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Clearly define all terms, conditions, and expectations</li>
          <li><strong>Set Duration:</strong> Specify how long the treaty will remain in effect</li>
          <li><strong>Include Consequences:</strong> Define what happens if the treaty is broken</li>
