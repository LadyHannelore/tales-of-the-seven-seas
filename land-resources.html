    <h2>Land & Resources</h2>
    <p><em>Mod: arthur</em></p>

    <section>
      <h3>Territory</h3>
      <p>Each player will have a territory on the map, marked by their color on a tile. You may only construct settlements, worldbuild, or spawn resources within your territory.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Expansions</h3>
      <p>Expansions are how you grow your territory peacefully — no wars needed. Cost 20 coins per tile (lower for herder lifestyle). The land you will expand into must be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unoccupied (unless farmer expanding into gatherer or herder land)</li>
        <li>Within settlement range (3 tiles by land, 3 tiles by calm sea with shipbuilding unlocked, 5 tiles by sea with open sea sailing unlocked)</li>
        <li>Visible on your region's map, including up to 3 tiles outside the regional border. Must provide a map of your expansion by marking your region's map</li>
        <li>Not of impassable terrain (ice, high mountains, etc)</li>
        <li>Contiguous with existing land on the map if expanding by land</li>
        <li>Sea expansion must be done from a coastal occupied tile to a coastal unoccupied tile within your sea settlement range</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="expansion-info">
        <h4>Expansion Window</h4>
        <p>From after the map is posted to Friday of the following week. Expansions posted outside the window will be deleted.</p>

      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>There are 4 resource types you may spawn from your land:</p>
      
      <div class="resource-types">
        <div class="resource-card">
          <h4>Food</h4>
          <p>Automatically spawn from tiles you have domestic lifeforms in (gatherers generate food from every tile). Will regenerate each cycle (14 days), depleting the food leftover from the last cycle.</p>
          <p><strong>Formula:</strong> food per tile = lifestyle modifier × terrain modifier</p>
          <p><strong>Total food:</strong> [farmland + (domestic lifeforms × 2) + native terrain food(gatherer) - population] rounded</p>
          <p>Food is required for feeding your population, exploration and construction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="resource-card">
          <h4>Spawned Resources</h4>
          <p>Can be spawned from your land using 1 labor and 1 tile as designated. Each spawnable tile may only be used once for spawning per cycle. Spawnable resources will not deplete at the end of the cycle. Must submit each spawn in the resource chat.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Timber:</strong> spawnable from all forest terrain tiles. Used in construction</li>
            <li><strong>Copper:</strong> spawnable from copper tiles. Used in construction and making bronze</li>
            <li><strong>Tin:</strong> spawnable from tin tiles. Used in making bronze</li>
            <li><strong>Mount:</strong> spawnable from any tile your mount is native to. Used in exploration and warfare</li>
            <li><strong>Books:</strong> spawnable from metropolis. Used in trading technologies</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="resource-card">
          <h4>Bronze</h4>
          <p>1 copper and 1 tin can be converted into 2 bronze. Used in construction and warfare. Must submit each spawn in the resource chat. Will not deplete at the end of each cycle.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="resource-card">
          <h4>Unique Resource</h4>
          <p>Unique resources are counted by type instead of amount, denoted by the resource name in the player sheet. Each cycle, each player may post a minimum 200 word roleplay to create a unique resource to their nation, ranging from rare gems and local textile to even cultural services or tourism that may grow your economy.</p>
          <p>Once approved, you may trade this resource to any player infinitely, while keeping your own, but this will count as 1 type (1 name). Used in construction, numbers indicate types. Will not deplete at the end of each cycle.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Trade System</h3>
      <p>Want to trade your goods with others? You can! You may trade with any player whose settlement is within your trade range.</p>
      
      <h4>Tradeable Goods</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Coins</li>
        <li>Any resources</li>
        <li>Labor</li>
        <li>Any personal creation or services</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Trade Routes</h4>
      <div class="trade-routes">
        <div class="route-type">
          <h5>By Land</h5>
          <p>Trade path must be between 2 settlements by land. Can cross over rivers, but not lakes or sea (water bodies that stretch across multiple tiles).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="route-type">
          <h5>By Sea</h5>
          <p>Trade path must be between 2 settlements by sea. You must unlock shipbuilding technology to trade by calm sea, and must unlock open sea sailing to trade by open sea.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="route-type">
          <h5>By River</h5>
          <p>Trade path must be between 2 settlements by the same river (connected without having to cross land or the ocean). Can be of any length, including outside the trade range.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Trade Types</h4>
      <p><strong>Direct trade:</strong> Between you and the target nation through 1 route. Target nation must be within your trade range (or on the same river).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Indirect trade:</strong> Passes through another nation's territory (the middleman). Each pair of settlements must be within trade range of each other. The middleman may block the trade, tax the trade, or take the goods as they want. If a middleman does not respond within 24 hours, the trade automatically goes through.</p>
