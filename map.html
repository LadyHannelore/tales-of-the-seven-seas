      <h3>Map Overview</h3>
      <p>Tales of the Seven Seas uses an <strong>alternate earth map</strong>, where each location on Earth corresponds to an alternate location on the map. Your roleplay nation will not be tied to that location’s real-life history. The terrain may change, so don't be afraid to try out new locations!</p>
      <p>Every 14 days on Monday, an updated version of the map will be posted in your region’s map chat. The map is separated into hexagonal tiles, showing the land, settlement, and resource spawning tiles that each person controls. Always use the latest posted map for any expansions or construction actions. You must own the territory on the map to interact with it.</p>
      <p><strong>DO NOT</strong> share your region map with another player or in general chat. You will ruin the exploration aspect for everyone. You may share hand-drawn maps, but you may alter those as much as you like.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="game-details">
      <h3>Visibility</h3>
      <p>You may only interact with areas visible to you on your region’s map. When anyone in the region creates a settlement, it will create a 5-tile visibility range around that settlement, by both land and sea. You may then expand or trade within this area, up to your settlement’s expansion/trade range. This will be visible to the entire region.</p>
      <p>You may only see up to 3 tiles outside your region. This will be marked by a lighter brown overlay. You can trade or expand within this area, where you will enter a new region. If the two regions are separated by sea, you cannot see beyond that region’s coastline. All impassable terrain will also block visibility.</p>
