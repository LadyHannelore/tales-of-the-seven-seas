      <h3>Worldbuilding Overview</h3>
      <p>Worldbuilding posts are not only great for storytelling but also the main way of generating coins in this game. You may post anything from roleplay, art, essays, short stories, memes, descriptions, or other works!</p>
      <p>Each post must be 100% fictional. You are encouraged to do research about real-world aspects and apply it to your worldbuilding, but should not mention it in your description.</p>
      <p>Your worldbuilding will be graded from 0-30 coins based on quality. You may also collaborate with other players, and the coins will be divided between both.</p>
      <p><strong>You cannot post AI-generated content.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Roleplay & Short Story:</strong> Roleplay as characters or tell a short story about your nation. Must be at least 50 words long.</li>
        <li><strong>Art:</strong> Create art relating to your nation or region, from fictional lifeforms to culture to events.</li>
        <li><strong>Essay & Description:</strong> Write essays or short descriptions detailing aspects of your region. Must be at least 50 words long.</li>
        <li><strong>Memes:</strong> Create memes about events that happen with nations within your region. Memes will be graded lower than other forms of worldbuilding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Exceptional posts may receive additional rewards, such as canonization or being added to the Hall of Fame.</p>
