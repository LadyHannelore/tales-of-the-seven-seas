**You must create a fictional nation to play as.**  
You can’t play as any real culture or people, but may be inspired by them, putting a spin on it. Your worldbuilding can be as creative as you want, but no sci-fi or fantasy.

1. Select a real-life region from the region map shown below, which corresponds to an alternate location in the game’s alternate earth map.
2. React to get a role for that region in (). You can only pick one region.
3. Create a spawning ticket in ().
4. List the following details:
   - **username**
   - **nation name**
   - **Lifestyle**
   - **Capital (fictional)**
   - A map showing your capital, 1 more settlement, and 5 tiles (including your settlements), which must be contiguous by land, or no further than a neighboring sea tile by sea.

The spawning mod will confirm your spawn and send you a map showing your final spawn. You may change your capital or lifestyle to fit your map location, and can select a new tile if your selected tile isn’t available on the map.
