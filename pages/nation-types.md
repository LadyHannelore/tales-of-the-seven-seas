- **Player Nations**: Regular nations played by users.
- **Mod Nations**: Played by mods with extra restrictions and rewards:
  - View the full map; expand without exploring (unless on the frontier).
  - Cannot post exploration roleplay; earn 100 coins/month for mod work.
  - Two Mod nations cannot jointly declare war on a single Player nation (unless that Player is regionally dominant).
  - Cannot share undiscovered internal game info.
- **NPC Nations**: Mods control these for narrative; they have only Lifestyle and one Culture ability.
