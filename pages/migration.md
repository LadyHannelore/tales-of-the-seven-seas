In emergencies (e.g., full annexation), you may migrate once per gameplay as a soft respawn:

1. Ping the spawning mod to remove your region role.
2. Select a new region role and spawn with a ticket.

You may migrate with:
- Up to 20% of your population (max 10).
- 1 tile per migrating population.
- Settlements built from leftover resources and coins (if resources insufficient, reduce migrating pop).
- Any leftover resources, populations, settlements, and coins are lost or go to conquerors.
