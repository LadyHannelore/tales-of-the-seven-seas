    <h2>War System</h2>
    <p>Ready to fight some wars? You may declare war against 1 nation to capture land, cities, loot (check siege section), or gain diplomatic favors.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>War Declaration</h3>
      <p>To declare a war you must select 1 of 4 casus belli, which will determine your victory requirement, and your victory and defeat conditions. When a victory requirement is met, a war ends with the victor gaining the victory condition. If the victory requirement is not met, the opponent will gain the defeat condition.</p>
      
      <p>After selecting a casus belli, create a war ticket, mention your opponent, and create your war declaration message.</p>

      <h3>Army System</h3>
      <p>Armies will let you conquer cities, raid, and protect your land. You may create an army with 1 labor, which will stop the labor from regenerating until the war ends.</p>
      
      <p>At the beginning of a war, both sides may distribute their armies around their settlements however they like, at a maximum equal to that settlement's population (1 for town, 3 for cities, 5 for metropolis).</p>
      
      <h4>Army Composition</h4>
      <p>Each army consist of individual <strong>units</strong> you may use in battle or maneuver across the battlefield. 1 army automatically start with 5 infantry units and 1 commander unit. The player may purchase 2 more modifications per army at the following cost, adding those units to your army. You may purchase these modifications at any time during the war.</p>
      
      <div class="army-units">
        <div class="unit-cost">
          <span class="cost">1 bronze:</span> 3 shock unit
        </div>

      <h3>Maneuvering</h3>
      <p>Each war is divided into turns, one turn lasting 1-3 days. For each turn, you may choose to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maneuver:</strong> Move each army 3 tiles by land (or water after unlocking shipbuilding). If the army move outside of their nation's expansion range (3 tiles around each settlement), they must pay 1 food per 3 tile movement, or 1 mount for 6 tile movement. 2 armies may occupy the same tile</li>
        <li><strong>Battle</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Do nothing</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="maneuver-rules">
        <h4>Maneuver Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If both players choose to do nothing for 2 turns, the war will end</li>
          <li>If a player does not respond in their turn after 3 days, they are considered as doing nothing unless specified later</li>
          <li>If an army maneuvers through foreign territory, that player may choose to approve of the maneuver, start a war with the maneuvering army, or fund the maneuvering army by trading them goods</li>
          <li>They may not join the war themselves against the same target</li>
          <li>If the nation approves, your maneuvering will not count as being beyond expansion range and thus does not need extra food</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h3>Battle System</h3>
      <p>When 2 or more armies occupy the same tile, any of them may decide to start a battle. This is done using a board game, war chess, where each unit will move on a 9×9 board to eliminate all enemy units on the board.</p>
      
      <h4>Unit Types</h4>
      <p>Each unit has the following property in war chess: Attack, Defense, and movement.</p>

      <h4>Battle Phases</h4>
      <p>War chess is divided into 3 phases, placement, battle, and rally phase. The aggressor will be red, and the defender will be blue.</p>
      
      <div class="battle-phases">
        <div class="phase-card">
          <h5>Placement Phase</h5>
          <p>Starting with red, the player may place their unit anywhere on the 5×2 area on their side of the board. Then the blue player will get their turn.</p>
          <p>If you have more than 1 army within the tile, you may place all army's unit on the battlefield, but with only 1 commander. When placing a chariot unit, each chariot must have 1 rider unit being either infantry, archer, shock, or commander. Infantry unit serve as a default rider for the chariot and will not subtract from your infantry unit.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="phase-card">
          <h5>Battle Phase</h5>
          <p>Red player gets their turn first. Each turn, you may do 1 of 4 action per unit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Move the unit</li>
            <li>Turn the unit to face any 4 directions</li>
            <li>Attack: for archers only</li>
            <li>Nothing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After you have moved all units, you may end your turn. Your movement cannot be canceled. Then, the death of each side's unit will be calculated.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="phase-card">
          <h5>Rally Phase</h5>
          <p>At the end of a battle, each side will calculate the remaining units in their army:</p>
          <p><strong>Remaining units = Surviving units + Retreated units (your own) + captured units (from the opponent)</strong></p>
          <p>If your remaining units no longer have a commander, it will be added to 1 army of your choice. Your remaining units will constitute your army, which you may continue to use to fight the war.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Siege</h4>
      <p>Sieges constitute a special kind of battle, centered around settlements. When opposing armies are on a settlement tile, they may declare a siege. The siege will be fought with all armies in the settlement tile, including those who never left the settlement. If the settlement is unguarded, it is automatically captured.</p>
      
      <p>In a siege, your army may be placed anywhere on the 4×9 area on your side of the board.</p>
      
      <p>If a commander is no longer from the board, the opponent automatically conquers the settlement. If they do, they will gain 1 loot per town, 4 per city, and 9 per metropolis. Each loot represents goods you can demand from your opponent.</p>
      
      <div class="loot-values">
        <h5>Loot Values</h5>
        <p>1 loot can be demanded for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 labor</li>
          <li>30 coins</li>
          <li>2 resources of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goods you selected must be owned by the opposing nation.</p>
