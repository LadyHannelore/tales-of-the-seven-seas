      <h2>War Declaration</h2>
      <p>Ready to fight some wars? You may declare war against one nation to capture land, cities, loot, or gain diplomatic favors. To declare, select one of four <em>casus belli</em>. This determines victory requirements and outcomes. After choosing, create a war ticket, mention your opponent, and attach a map of your target tiles.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Both sides enter a mutual two-week cooldown after war ends. You cannot declare a new war while already at war or during cooldown.</p>

      <h2>Armies & Units</h2>
      <p>Create an army by spending 1 labor (this halts labor regen). At war start, distribute armies by settlement population (1 for town, 3 for city, 5 for metropolis). Each army (max 10 units) begins with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 Infantry units</li>
        <li>1 Commander unit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Purchase up to two unit upgrades per army:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Bronze → 3 Shock units</li>
        <li>1 Timber → 3 Archer units</li>
        <li>1 Mount → 4 Cavalry units</li>
        <li>1 Mount → 2 Chariot units</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maneuvering & Battle</h2>
      <p>Wars proceed in 1–3 day turns:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Maneuver:</strong> Move armies up to 3 tiles (land) or as allowed by ship tech. Exiting expansion range costs food or mounts. Allied territory requires permission to avoid extra cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle:</strong> Armies on the same tile may initiate war chess on a 9×9 board. Each unit has Attack, Defense, and Movement stats; battles resolve via placement, combat, and rally phases.</li>
        <li><strong>No Action:</strong> If either side is inactive for 3 consecutive turns (skips actions or no response within 3 days), the war ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn Limit:</strong> A war automatically ends after 10 turns regardless of activity.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Sieges & Treaties</h2>
      <p>Sieges occur on settlement tiles; unguarded cities fall automatically. Siege battles use the same war chess rules on a 4×9 board. Loot is granted per settlement tier.</p>
      <p>Treaties allow diplomatic deals. Post in worldbuilding chat and sign. They have no automatic effect unless enforced by writing tech or as peace treaties.</p>
